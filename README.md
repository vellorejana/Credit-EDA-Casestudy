# Credit-EDA-Casestudy
This case study aims to give you an idea of applying EDA in a real business scenario. In this case study, apart from applying the techniques that I have learnt in the EDA module, I will also develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers.
